            At Bright Hygiene, unlike most other companies, we do not 
            ask for a signed service agreement. You simply tell us how 
            often you would like the service which is entered into our 
            database so that we can schedule a call to you a few weeks 
            before your service is due to arrange a date and time that 
            totally fits in with your kitchen routine. 
            <br><br>
            To enable us to prepare a deep clean quotation, our surveyor 
            will carry out a free survey and prepare a survey report, 
            site specific risk assessments, recommendation charter and 
            quotation that is fully tailor-made to suit your needs and 
            your timing.

      <h2>Kitchen deep cleaning</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        A regular deep clean is an essential part of any hygiene schedule for all kitchens to ensure that areas outside the scope of the daily clean down are dealt with effectively. Food and grease build up underneath and behind units, baked-on oils and carbon on hot equipment and ventilation canopies, all need to be tackled by fully trained and skilled personnel using aggressive and often hazardous cleaning agents.
      <br><br>
      Since 1978 Bright Hygiene has been operating a Kitchen Deep Clean Service that has been perfected over the years. Our emphasis on quality backed by strict working practices and Health and Safety procedures has enabled us to achieve an enviable portfolio of clients across all market sectors.
      <br><br>
      Many of our customers have a complete kitchen deep clean that covers all the four critical areas that require regular attention.  However, to make the service more flexible, clients can choose to select a specific service that is best suited their requirements

    <h2>Air supply</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    Ventilation is provided by an Air Handling Unit (AHU) and is used to control indoor air quality. Excess humidity, odours, and contaminants can often be controlled via dilution or replacement with outside air. However, in humid climates more energy is required to remove excess moisture from ventilation air.

    <h2>Why is clean airflow so important?</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and the Workplace regulations 1992 both require a “safe and clean working environment” which includes the air quality in your building, whether it’s a multi-level office building or a warehouse.
    <br><br>
    The effect of poor or inadequate air supply can and often does, lead to sick building syndrome (SBS).

    Ventilation is provided by an Air Handling Unit (AHU) and is used to control indoor air quality. Excess humidity, odours, and contaminants can often be controlled via dilution or replacement with outside air. However, in humid climates more energy is required to remove excess moisture from ventilation air.

    The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and the Workplace regulations 1992 both require a “safe and clean working environment” which includes the air quality in your building, whether it’s a multi-level office building or a warehouse.
