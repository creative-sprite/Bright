            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="orange-font">Quality Control</strong><br>
              <p>The Supplier warrants that the services will be performed in a professional manner consistent with the industry standards. The Supplier will take every precaution to ensure the clients expectations of delivery are met by employing quality control measures, regular contact, education of clients, satisfaction / sign off notices, the contracting of The Customers View to gain feedback and any other control measures the supplier sees fit to put in place to ensure maximum quality output. The information will be fed back on a quarterly basis to the Client if required. When the consortium model is applicable a self-policing will be adopted in addition whereby services are verified / benchmarked, and quality checked by opposing members on a 6-monthly rotation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="orange-font">Prices</strong>
              <ol>
                <li><p>Unless expressly stated otherwise, all prices quoted are net prices.  Any applicable value added tax or any other sales tax excise duties paid payable by the Supplier shall be payable by the Client. Unless agreed otherwise, our minimum charge for any service is £495 excluding VAT.</p></li>
                <li><p>The schedule of service prices for the agreed specification will remain fixed for two years from the Service Commencement Date, at which point they will be subject to review by the Supplier, within a reasonable rate of inflation.</p></li>
                <li><p>The terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been conclusively accepted by the client if a signed agreement is forwarded back to the Supplier and thereafter no variation to any of the terms of the agreement shall be effective unless agreed in writing by duly authorized signatories of both the Client and the Supplier.</p></li>
                <li><p>In the event of the Client (site) cancelling all or part of an order a cancellation charge (abortive) charge of 50% of the agreed price may be levied if cancellation takes place with less than 48 hours working days notice or if Client (site) does not comply with reasonable requests made by the Supplier. Please be advised we will take every precaution to ensure this is a last resort measure only.</p></li>
                <li><p>The Supplier reserves the right to revise the prices quoted at any time in the event of changes in legislation or the introduction of European Directives which increases the cost of supply of service. Nothing in this agreement, shall prevent the Supplier from exercising the right to review and increase the standard daily fee rates, at any time in the event of unforeseen circumstances that increase the costs of providing the Services (for example where additional panels are used), particularly where the Supplier forms the opinion that incurring such costs would bring the Client in line with legislation, industry standards, health and safety rules and regulations and any other such provisions.</p></li>
                <li><p>Prices will be calculated using a strict pricing matrix that the Supplier employs to ensure parity in quoting.

Where, at clients request and or site restrictions require the team to complete works within a given timeframe period, less than the 8 hours required. The Supplier reserves the right to charge for additional manpower to facilitate the completion of the works either within the given time or at an alternative time/date suitable to the client’s requirements.</p></li>
                <li><p>The Supplier will match a competitor’s quotation, if, in the event a cheaper service is sourced.

                <li><p>In the event that the Client has not cleared down their facilities sufficiently on arrival to the satisfaction of the Supplier, in order to allow a Service to be provided under any Specification, without prejudice and in addition to, any other right or remedy that the Supplier may have, a charge of £200.00 shall be levied by the Supplier on the Client, plus another £200.00 charge should the Supplier have to return Client’s Equipment, fixtures and fittings or any other items after provision of the Services.</p></li>
